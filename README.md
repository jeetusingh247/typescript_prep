## Introduction

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers static typing, classes, and interfaces, which help you build robust and maintainable applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the TypeScript compiler:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true
    }
}
```

## Basic Types

Learn about the basic types in TypeScript, such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`, `tuple`, `enum`, `any`, `void`, `null`, and `undefined`.

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the structure of an object. They are used for type-checking and ensuring that objects adhere to a specific shape.

## Classes

Classes in TypeScript are similar to those in other object-oriented languages. They support inheritance, access modifiers, and more.

## Functions

Functions in TypeScript can have typed parameters and return types. Learn about function overloading, default parameters, and rest parameters.

## Generics

Generics provide a way to create reusable components. They allow you to define functions, classes, and interfaces with a placeholder for the type.

## Modules

Modules in TypeScript help you organize your code. Learn about exporting and importing modules, and how to use namespaces.

## Advanced Types

Explore advanced types such as union types, intersection types, type guards, type inference, and type compatibility.

## Decorators

Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. They are used to modify the behavior of the target.

## TypeScript with React

Learn how to use TypeScript with React to build type-safe and scalable applications. Understand the benefits of using TypeScript with React components, props, and state.
